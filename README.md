## Overview

**land4health** is a tool developed within the HARMONIZE project to
analyze frequency-grouped, weighted, and multi-source environmental
indicators. The tool comprises a R package with comprehensive
documentation, including usage examples and parameter selection
guidelines tailored to specific case studies.

The functions that are part of the tool allow for:

- Calculation of zonal statistics, such as **mean**, **maximum**,
  **minimum**, **median**, **standard deviation**, **variance**,
  **sum**, and **min-max range** of climate variables

- Processing of environmental data by grouping indicators by frequency
  and applying weights.

- Visualization of spatial and temporal patterns of environmental
  indicators.
