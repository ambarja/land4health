Calculate and extract remote sensing metrics for spatial health analysis üõ∞Ô∏è.
This package offers R users a quick and easy way to obtain areal or zonal statistics of key indicators and covariates, ideal for modeling infectious diseases ü¶† within the framework of spatial epidemiology üè•.

## Installation

You can install the development version of land4health from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("harmonize-tools/land4health")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(land4health)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```
