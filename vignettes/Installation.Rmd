This vignette shows how to install the required components and register a new user on the **Google Earth Engine platform**, in order to use its API within the land4health package to access and extract multiple variables relevant to **Spatial Epidemiology**.

##  1.1 What is Google Earth Engine?

Google Earth Engine is a cloud-based platform that helps access high-performance computing resources for processing and analyzing large geospatial datasets (Noel Golerick et al.,2017).


## 1.2 Objectives:
- Be accessible to various professionals without being experts in handling supercomputers.
- Reduce pre-post processing time of satellite images on a local, regional or global scale.
- Implement application development without being a backend/frontend expert.
- Boost the development of big data for remote sensing.

## 1.3 Components:

- Data catalog: Curated collection of several petabytes of geospatial datasets widely used in remote sensing available to the general public.

- High performance computing service: Googleâ€™s computational infrastructure to optimize parallel processing and distribution of geospatial data.

- API and client libraries: Application programming interface for making requests to Earth Engine servers.
  - API
    - Client libraries
    - Code Editor
    - REST API
  - Client libraries:
    - JavaScript
    - Python
    - R (no official)
