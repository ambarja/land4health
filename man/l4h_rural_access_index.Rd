\usage{
l4h_rural_access_index(
  region,
  weighted = FALSE,
  fun = NULL,
  sf = FALSE,
  force = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{region}{A spatial object defining the region of interest.
Can be an Earth Engine geometry (e.g., \code{ee$FeatureCollection}, \code{ee$Feature}),
an \code{sf} or \code{sfc} object, or a \code{SpatVector} (from the \pkg{terra} package).
The object will be converted to an Earth Engine FeatureCollection if needed.}

\item{weighted}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, computes a population-weighted RAI (i.e., rural population with access
divided by total rural population). If \code{FALSE}, computes an area-based RAI (i.e., total pixel area with access
divided by total rural area). Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{fun}{Character. Summary function to apply to the population raster when \code{weighted = TRUE}.
Common values include \code{"mean"}, \code{"sum"}, etc. Ignored when \code{weighted = FALSE}. Default is \code{"mean"}.}

\item{sf}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, returns the result as an \code{sf} object. If \code{FALSE},
returns an Earth Engine object. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{force}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, skips the representativity check and forces the extraction. Default is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
A spatial object containing the computed RAI value for the region in an
\code{sf} or \code{tibble} object.
}
\description{
Calculates the Rural Access Index (RAI) for a given region using datasets from the GEE Community Catalog.
The RAI represents the proportion of the rural population living within 2 km of an all-season road,
aligning with SDG indicator 9.1.1.
}
\details{
\ifelse{html}{\href{https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#stable}{\figure{lifecycle-stable.svg}{options: alt='[Stable]'}}}{\strong{[Stable]}}

This function uses the following datasets from the GEE Community Catalog:
\itemize{
\item \code{projects/sat-io/open-datasets/RAI/ruralpopaccess} – raster of rural population with access to all-season roads
\item \code{projects/sat-io/open-datasets/RAI/inaccessibilityindex} – binary raster indicating access areas (1 = access, 0 = no access)
}

When \code{weighted = TRUE}, the RAI is calculated as the sum (or chosen summary via \code{fun}) of the accessible rural population
divided by the total rural population within the specified region.

When \code{weighted = FALSE}, the RAI is calculated as the ratio of pixel areas: the total area (in km²) with access
divided by the total rural area.

The \code{fun} parameter only applies when \code{weighted = TRUE}. It will be ignored otherwise.
