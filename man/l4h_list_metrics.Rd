\title{List available metrics in \emph{land4health}}
\usage{
l4h_list_metrics(
  category = NULL,
  metric = NULL,
  provider = NULL,
  open_in_browser = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{category}{Optional single string. Filter by thematic category.}

\item{metric}{Optional single string. Filter by metric short name.}

\item{provider}{Optional single string. Filter by the \code{dataset} column.}

\item{open_in_browser}{Logical; open the matching URLs in your browser?
Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
A tibble (returned \emph{invisibly}).  When \code{open_in_browser = FALSE}
a compact preview (max 10 rows) is printed before the tibble is
returned.
}
\description{
Returns a tibble with the metadata of every metric shipped with
\strong{land4health}.  You can optionally filter by thematic \emph{category}, metric
short name, or \emph{provider}.
If \code{open_in_browser = TRUE}, all matching URLs are opened in your default
browser; for safety you \strong{must} supply at least one filter, and—if more than
five tabs would open—you are asked to confirm in interactive sessions.
}
\examples{
## All examples keep `open_in_browser = FALSE` to avoid side-effects
## during automated checks.

## 1  Show the full inventory (truncated to 10 rows).
l4h_list_metrics()

## 2  Filter by category (“Human intervention”).
l4h_list_metrics(category = "Human intervention")

## 3  Filter by provider (“WorldPop”) and store the result.
worldpop_tbl <- l4h_list_metrics(provider = "WorldPop")
head(worldpop_tbl)

## 4  Pipe into dplyr (executes in < 1 s, loaded only if available).
if (requireNamespace("dplyr", quietly = TRUE)) {
  l4h_list_metrics() |>
    dplyr::filter(pixel_resolution_meters <= 100) |>
    dplyr::select(metric, start_year, end_year)
}

## 5  Trying to open links without filters triggers an error;
##    wrapped in \dontrun{} so R CMD check is not interrupted.
\dontrun{
l4h_list_metrics(open_in_browser = TRUE)
}
}
